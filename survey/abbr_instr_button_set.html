        <p>In the survey, you will be playing ${e://Field/num_rounds} rounds of investment games.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In each round, you will have limited time to look at 2 investment portfolios. Each portfolio includes <b>100 companies</b>, represented by a grid of <b>100 dots</b>. <b>Red</b> dots represent <b>good</b> companies, and <b>black</b> dots represent <b>bad</b> companies. Your job as an investor is to <b>judge</b> the number of good companies in each portfolio, and <b>make investment decisions. </b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>You have 3 opportunities to earn bonus money:</p>
        
        <ul>
         <li>Making good investments</li>
         <li>Scoring in the top&nbsp;${e://Field/num_winners} in the investment games</li>
         <li>Making accurate guesses about the number of good companies in the portfolios</li>
        </ul>
        <i>The better you are at investing in these portfolios, the more money you will earn.&nbsp;</i>You will learn more details later.

            An investment portfolio (or portfolio henceforth) contains stocks from&nbsp;<strong>100 companies</strong>, and each company is either good (profitable) or bad (unprofitable). Portfolios with more good companies&nbsp;will earn you more money than portfolios with fewer good companies.
        </p>
        <br>           
         <p>
            For this experiment, we have constructed a collection of <strong>1000 such portfolios</strong>. For <strong>each number of good companies (X-Axis)</strong>, the following figure (called a histogram) tells you <strong>how many of the portfolios</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Y-Axis)</strong> have that number of good companies. The <b>average</b> number of good companies for portfolios in this collection is <strong>50</strong>.
         </p>   
         <br>
            
            <strong>The portfolios you see in this experiment will come from this collection of portfolios.</strong> <br>

        <p>
            The interface will represent each portfolio as a <strong>square grid of 100 dots</strong>, where each dot&nbsp;is either <strong>black or red</strong>.

        </p><br>
            <ul>
            <li>The <b>number of good companies</b>&nbsp;of a portfolio is equal to the&nbsp;<strong>number of red dots&nbsp;</strong>in the square grid.</li>
            <li>The <b>number of </b><strong>bad companies</strong> is equal to the <b>number of</b> <strong>black dots.</strong></li>
            <li>The location of the red and black dots are&nbsp;<strong>RANDOMLY DETERMINED.</strong></li>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Summary of A Round</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            In each round, you will encounter 2 investment portfolios. Each portfolio contains 100 companies, represented by 100 dots. Good companies are red dots, and bad companies are black dots.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            When a round begins, the interface will select <strong>2 portfolios</strong>&nbsp;that are&nbsp;<b>RANDOMLY DRAWN</b>&nbsp;from the collection of 1000 portfolios. Each portfolio contains <b>100 companies</b>. The pair of portfolios are re-selected every round.
        </p>
       <br>
        <p>
             In a given round you will complete 3 tasks:
        </p>        

        <ol>
         <li>See half portfolios, and Guess the number of good companies in the half portfolios</li>
         <li>See complete portfolios, and Guess the number of good companies in the complete portfolios</li>
         <li>Invest in a&nbsp;portfolio</li>
        </ol><br>

        <p>
            To maximize your earning you should <strong>INVEST</strong> in the portfolio that you <strong>JUDGE</strong> to have more good companies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The <b>order</b> of tasks 2 and 3 might <b>differ</b> in different rounds:

        </p>        
        <ul>
         <li>In some rounds, you will encounter<em>&nbsp;Half Portfolios</em> --&gt;<em>&nbsp;Complete Portfolios</em> --&gt; <em>Investment</em></li>
         <li>In other rounds, you will encounter<em>&nbsp;Half Portfolios</em> --&gt; <em>Investment</em> --&gt;<em>&nbsp;Complete Portfolios</em></li>
        </ul><b>
        Therefore, please pay attention to the instruction in each round.</b>
