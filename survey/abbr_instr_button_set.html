        There is a collection of <strong>1000 investment portfolios</strong>. Each investment portfolio contains <strong>100 companies</strong>, and each company is either good (profitable) or bad (unprofitable). Each&nbsp;portfolio contains good companies and bad companies.<br>
        <br>
        A portfolio is <strong>better</strong> than another one if it has <strong>more good companies</strong>.&nbsp;The following figure, which is called a histogram, depicts the distribution of the <strong>number of good companies in a portfolio</strong> for this collection of 1000 investment portfolios.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <img width="400" src="http://christinasun.net/asset_hosting_service/matrix_graphs/dist_histogram.png" height="400"><br>
        This figure can be read as follows. The<strong> horizontal axis</strong> shows each possible <strong>number of good companies</strong>, from 0 to 100. For each possible number, the height of the corresponding bar depicts the <strong>number of portfolios</strong> that have that number of good companies (as shown on the <strong>vertical axis</strong>).<br>
        <br>
        For example, there are 13 portfolios with 45 good companies &nbsp;in this collection, and 40 portfolios with 50 good companies.  <br> The portfolios you see in this experiment come from this collection.  </div>

    <p>This experiment consists of $${e://Field/num_rounds} rounds. Your tasks in each round consists of 4 stages.</p>

        <br>
        <p><em>Stage 1: Preparation Stage</em></p>
        <br />
        When a round begins, the interface will select <strong>2 portfolios</strong>&nbsp;that are&nbsp;<b>RANDOMLY DRAWN</b>&nbsp;from the collection of 1000 portfolios.&nbsp;</h4>
        
        <ul>
         <li>One of the portfolios is better than the other (has more good companies).</li>
        </ul>
        Your job in a round is to <b>JUDGE</b>&nbsp;the number of good companies for <strong>BOTH</strong> of the portfolios, and choose one portfolio to&nbsp;<strong>INVEST</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;based on your judgment.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The interface will represent each portfolio as a <strong>square grid of 100 dots</strong>, where each dot&nbsp;is either <strong>black or red</strong>.
        
        <ul>
         <li>The <b>number of good companies</b>&nbsp;of a portfolio is equal to the&nbsp;<strong>number of red dots&nbsp;</strong>in the square grid.</li>
         <li>The location of the red and black dots are&nbsp;<strong>RANDOMLY DETERMINED.</strong></li>

        </ul>
   
        <br>
        <p><em>Stage 2</em></p> 
&nbsp;

        <ol>
        <li>In the second stage, you will be shown&nbsp;<strong>HALF </strong>of the&nbsp;portfolios (whether the top or bottom halves are shown is random).

        <ul>
        <li>They will be shown for&nbsp;${e://Field/seconds_shown} seconds.</li>
        <li>You will&nbsp;<strong>report</strong>&nbsp;how many good companies&nbsp;<strong>you think</strong>&nbsp;are in each of the two<strong>&nbsp;half portfolios</strong>.</li>

        <li>The interface will automatically calculate the <strong>predicted number</strong> of good companies by <strong>multiplying your guess</strong> for the half portfolios <strong>by 2</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><em>Stage 3 and Stage 4</em></p>
        <br>
        <ol>
        <li>In some rounds, you will make your <strong>investment</strong> decision in <strong>stage 3,</strong>&nbsp;after seeing the half portfolios. In<strong> other rounds</strong>, you will make your investment decision in<strong> stage 4,&nbsp;</strong>after you see both the half portfolios and the complete portfolios<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You <strong>won&#39;t know</strong> when you will make the investment decision until <b>after stage 2</b>.</li>
        <li>Below are examples of&nbsp;<strong>COMPLETE&nbsp;</strong>portfolios.&nbsp;
        <ul>
        <li>Portfolio A and B are the&nbsp;same portfolios as above (portfolios do not change throughout a given round).</li>
        <li>They will be shown for&nbsp;${e://Field/seconds_shown} seconds.</li>
      
        </li>
        <li>You will then&nbsp;<strong>report</strong>&nbsp;how many good companies <strong>you think</strong> are in each of the two <strong>complete portfolios.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How to make your investment decision:
        <ul>
        <li>You will be able to invest in&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;portfolio each round.</li>
        <li>Investing in the portfolio with&nbsp;<strong>more good companies</strong>&nbsp;will give you a higher payoff. This is explained in detail next.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>

    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li>At the end of the experiment, <strong>one round</strong> will be <strong>randomly selected </strong>to calculate your bonus payment.</li>
            <li>In this selected round, if you&nbsp;successfully <strong>chose to invest </strong>in the<strong> better portfolio</strong> (i.e., the portfolio with more good companies), you will earn a bonus of <strong>$${e://Field/choice_bonus}.</strong></li>
            <li>One of the two portfolios in that round is randomly selected, and one of your guesses&nbsp;on the number of good companies in that portfolio&nbsp;will be randomly chosen. If your guess&nbsp;is <strong>no further than 5</strong> from the<strong> true number,</strong> you will receive a bonus of <strong>$${e://Field/belief_bonus}.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>For example, if the true number of good companies in the portfolio is 63, then you will receive&nbsp;$${e://Field/belief_bonus} if you report any number between (and including) 58 and 68.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>However, if your guess is any other number, you will receive $0.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This payment scheme means that you should <strong>treat each round as if it would be used for payment</strong>, and try your best to <strong>make your best judgments and best guesses</strong>.</li>
            <li>You will <strong>not receive feedback</strong> between rounds, and will learn your bonus details at the <strong>end of the experiment</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
